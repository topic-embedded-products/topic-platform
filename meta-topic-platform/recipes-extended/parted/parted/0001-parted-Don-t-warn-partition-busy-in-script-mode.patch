Subject: [PATCH] parted: Don't warn partition busy in script mode

Script mode promises not to ask for input interactively.  However,
during 'rm' and 'resizepart' operations, then a partition is mounted,
parted asks for confirmation on the terminal.  Since upon confirmation
parted allows the actual operations to proceed allow scripts to do
this as well by assuming 'yes' in both the cases.

Fixes the following issues:
 - #22167
 - #24215
 - lpbug #1270203
